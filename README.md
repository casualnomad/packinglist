## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Live Demo
Visit the deployed version and start generating packing lists immediately.

### Option 2: Self-Host
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Configure the Cloudflare Worker URL (see below)

## 🛠 Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- A Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Claude API access key

### Deploying the AI Backend (Cloudflare Worker)

This app relies on a Cloudflare Worker to communicate with Claude AI. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Cloudflare Worker:**
   - Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
   - Go to **Workers & Pages** → **Create Application** → **Create a Worker**

2. **Deploy the worker code:**
   - Replace the default code with the contents of `worker.js`
   - Set your Claude API key in the Worker secrets:
     ```bash
     wrangler secret put CLAUDE_API_KEY
     # Then paste your Claude API key when prompted
     ```

3. **Update the Worker URL:**
   - In `index.html`, find this line:
     ```javascript
     const WORKER_URL = 'https://cold-hat-479c.github-0b8.workers.dev';
     ```
   - Replace it with your Worker's URL (found in the Cloudflare dashboard)

4. **Test it:**
   - Open `index.html` and generate a test packing list

## 📋 How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Setup Screen** — Enter trip details:
   - Destination / Trip type
   - Bag/Kit model
   - Weight limit
   - Travel dates and duration
   - Activities and trip style
   - Climate and personal notes

2. **AI Generation** — The app sends your trip details to Claude AI via the Cloudflare Worker, which:
   - Analyzes your destination and activities
   - Tailors recommendations to local climate and culture
   - Creates 6–10 organized categories
   - Estimates item weights
   - Suggests cost-effective options

3. **Your Packing List** — Interactive list with:
   - Checkboxes to track progress
   - Weight tracking
   - Color-coded badges (Key Item, To Buy, Buy Local, Hire Locally)
   - Destination-specific tips for each item

4. **Export & Share** — Download as CSV or reset and start a new trip

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `index.html`:
```css
:root {
  --bg: #0f1117;           /* Background */
  --accent: #f4a622;       /* Primary accent */
  --accent2: #e8623a;      /* Secondary accent */
  --green: #4ecb71;        /* Success/checked */
  --red: #e84f4f;          /* Warnings/errors */
  /* ... etc */
}
```

### Add More Emoji Icons
Update the `EMOJIS` array in `index.html`:
```javascript
const EMOJIS = ['👕','🧥','👟','👜', /* add more */];
```

### Adjust AI Prompt
Edit the `buildPrompt()` function in `index.html` to change how Claude generates recommendations.

## 💾 Data Storage

- **Local Storage** — Lists are saved to browser localStorage with key `packListData_v2`
- **No Server Required** — Your data never leaves your device (except the AI generation prompt)
- **Manual Export** — Use the CSV export feature to backup or share lists

## 🔑 Key Features Explained

### Badges
- **🔥 Key Item** — Essential; don't forget this
- **🛒 To Buy** — Purchase before the trip
- **📍 Buy Local** — Cheaper or better to buy at destination
- **🤝 Hire Locally** — Rent or hire at your destination

### Weight Tracking
- Displays packed weight vs. total weight
- Shows progress toward your bag's capacity limit
- Color-coded: green (under limit), orange (close), red (over limit)

### Trip Intelligence
- Destination overview
- Activity recommendations
- Local cost estimates
- Climate details

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"API error" when generating a list:**
- Check that the Worker URL in `index.html` is correct
- Verify your Claude API key is set in Cloudflare Secrets
- Ensure you have Claude API credits remaining

**List not saving:**
- Check that localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading

**Cloudflare Worker errors:**
- Review Worker logs in the Cloudflare dashboard
- Check that the request format matches the expected JSON schema
